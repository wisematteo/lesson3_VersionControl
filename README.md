Connecting a DVCS to cloud9.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Entering git commands is difficult at first because you cant make a mistake. If you do make a mistake it's not a big deal but you must start over again.
2. The git commands all have a specific function and knowing which command to use is vital. The commands arn't complicated but they must be understood in relation to what the objective is.
3. The benefits of github are apparent, once you push your fist files to github, it makes sense why you would want a local and remote repository for files.
